                    <h2>Common Misconceptions About Locs </h2>

                   <ol>
                    <li><b>You cannot wash your locs</b></li>
                    <p> Depending on how you start your locs, it is generally advisable to wait 3-5 weeks before washing your <br> hair.
                 Washing your starter locs too frequently can cause unraveling, but unraveling can be fixed. As your <br>locs mature, you will be able to wash your hair regularly. Not washing your hair at all will have<br> detrimental effects on your hair; it can cause scalp issues and build-up that can develop into mold.</p>
                    <li><b>Locs are permanent</b></li>
                    <p>Locs are only permanent if you want them to be a permanent hairstyle. You can comb out or cut your <br> locs if you no longer desire to have them.  </p>
                    <li><b>Waiting longer between loc maintenance = thicker locs</b></li>
                    <p>So, here's the thing: Retwisting or interlocking your hair too often will cause thinning at the loc and<br> roots. However, the same can occur if you wait too long between maintenance days. Locs will try to join <br>each other to become one loc (marrying) and separating them can be a very painful and damaging<br> process. In other cases, the loose hair cannot hold the loc attached to it, which can result in the<br> loc falling off.  </p>
                    <li><b> Locs are not versatile </b></li>
                    <p>Not true! For loc inspiration, check out our official Pinterest Board here: <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/edensembrace/">Pinterest Page</a></p>
                    <li><b>You can only maintain your locs using one maintenance method </b></li>
                    <p>Though some are against this, you can maintain your locs using more than one method. I know several people with micro-locs and sister-locs who sometimes alternate between retwisting and interlocking without issue. With my first set, I alternated between the crochet method and palm rolling. I personally wouldn't <br> recommend it if you desire more uniform locs, but it is possible.  </p>
