                    <h2>The "Ugly Phase": Understanding the Journey </h2>
                    <p>Many people who have locs experience a period of dissatisfaction with their appearance, commonly referred to as the "ugly stage." This phase usually occurs within the first year of their loc journey. Unfortunately, there are certain opinions surrounding this phase that unintentionally play into negative stereotypes about growing locs. Some people deny the existence of this phase and/or claim that those who experience it are not ready to have locs. However, some acknowledge its existence but imply that locs are only attractive when they look a certain way. While it is important to discourage negative stereotypes, we should also be honest and not dismiss other people's experiences. </p> 
                    <p>In my experience, my “ugly stage” began when I became more aware of how others perceived me with my hair. My first set of locs was thicker and shorter than my current set, and I received negative comments about it. Though I liked how my hair looked, I became insecure about how I was perceived. So, I began to cover it with wigs and scarves. Eventually, I decided to split my locs into smaller ones. While I am happy with my current set, I still wonder if the negative comments influenced my decision to split them. </p>

                    <p>Yes, we should be proud of our hair. But considering that there are still stigmas surrounding Black hair, it is understandable that there are people within our community who still have a difficult relationship with their hair. Many people start dreadlocks to learn how to accept their hair the way it naturally grows, and it can be an adverse transition. We should encourage each other to embrace our hair through every stage and create a safe space for others to share their raw feelings about their journeys.  </p>
